# Time Series Analysis in R

This folder contains scripts from Chapters 4, 6, and 7, applying time series techniques to real and simulated financial datasets.

## 📁 Concepts Covered

- Creating `ts` and `xts` objects
- Simulating AR, MA, ARMA, and ARIMA processes
- Visualizing and decomposing time series data
- Applying ACF/PACF and differencing for stationarity
- Seasonal adjustments and rolling plots

## 📊 Libraries Used

- `xts`
- `tseries`
- `astsa`

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Build time series models using real-world financial data
- Diagnose stationarity and autocorrelation
- Simulate and visualize dynamic processes
