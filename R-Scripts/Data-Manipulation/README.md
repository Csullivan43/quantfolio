# Data Manipulation in R

This folder includes foundational R scripts from Chapters 2 and 3, focused on building strong data manipulation skills using vectors, matrices, lists, loops, and conditional logic.

## 📁 Concepts Covered

- Vector creation, indexing, and subsetting
- Arithmetic operations and data coercion
- Data structures: vectors, matrices, data frames, and lists
- Data types: numeric, character, logical, factors
- Control flow: if/else, for/while/repeat loops
- Date formatting and operations
- Visualization basics using `plot()`
- Nested conditions and custom functions

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Build and subset core data structures in R
- Apply control flow to automate decision logic
- Create structured data for financial modeling and simulations
